Trick play:
- Web: trick pile + turn display + click-to-play enabled only on your turn.
- T19: fixed click-to-play wiring, added client/server play attempt logging, added reducer-style test ensuring played cards are removed from the correct hand.

Kitty visibility update:
- Server: stop sending kitty cards in private payloads after discard; only send picked-up kitty during kitty phase.
- Web: hide kitty panel for bidder once phase advances past kitty.

Kitty points notice:
- Server: after kitty discard, detect whether any point cards are in kitty and broadcast `info:notice` "There are points in the kitty" (no details), once per hand.
- Web: show notice banner/toast and auto-dismiss.

T23:
- Server: track captured cards, last trick team, and cumulative game score; detect end-of-hand and apply engine scoring (last trick + kitty points + contract resolution) after final trick.
- Tests: added set and made hand scoring scenarios to validate score accumulation and phase transition.
