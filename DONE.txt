Updated server game state to retain picked-up kitty cards for bidder-only visibility and extended private hand payloads to include kitty cards during kitty/declareTrump phases. Added kittyPickedUpCards tracking and ensured discarded kitty is sent only to bidder after discard.

Web updates:
- wired game:error to show the error banner alongside room:error
- tightened kitty pickup/discard and trump declare button disables to require phase + bidder + discard selection
- show Kitty panel when kitty cards arrive in hand:private even if not marked bidder

Server trick stub:
- Added trick play handling: state tracks trickCards, play:card validates turn/card, removes from hand, advances turn, clears trick after four cards.
- Exposed trickCards in hand:state and added a test for play:card reducing hand size.
