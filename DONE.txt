Engine:
- Added trickRound helper module (applyPlay/isTrickComplete/trickWinner), exported from rook-engine, with tests for trump and rook high/low.

Server:
- Updated trick play to use engine legality + winner logic, track trick lead color, reset after each trick.
- Added tests for trump-wins resolution and follow-suit enforcement.

Web:
- Added trick-play UI: shows trick pile + whose turn, click-to-play enabled only on your turn, simple completion log line.

T19:
- Fixed click-to-play rendering for trick phase cards, added client/server play attempt logging, and added a reducer-style test ensuring played cards are removed from the correct hand.
- Verified play:card payload matches server expectations and game:error is surfaced via existing error banners in the hand view.
