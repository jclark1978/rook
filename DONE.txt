Trick play:
- Web: trick pile + turn display + click-to-play enabled only on your turn.
- T19: fixed click-to-play wiring, added client/server play attempt logging, added reducer-style test ensuring played cards are removed from the correct hand.

Kitty visibility update:
- Server: stop sending kitty cards in private payloads after discard; only send picked-up kitty during kitty phase.
- Web: hide kitty panel for bidder once phase advances past kitty.

Kitty points notice:
- Server: after kitty discard, detect whether any point cards are in kitty and broadcast `info:notice` "There are points in the kitty" (no details), once per hand.
- Web: show notice banner/toast and auto-dismiss.

T22: Server dealer rotation + left-of-dealer bidding start + capture tracking:
- Added dealer seat to game/hand state, and rotate dealer clockwise when starting a new hand in the same room.
- Bidding now starts at the seat to the dealer's left; default dealer keeps existing initial turn order.
- Captured trick cards tracked per team with last trick winner team recorded after each completed trick.
- Tests added for left-of-dealer bidding start and capture tracking on trick completion; all server tests passing.
